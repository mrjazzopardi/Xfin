# Database Setup Instructions

## Problem
You're seeing the error: "Failed to load cash flow data: relation 'public.transactions' does not exist"

This indicates that your Supabase database schema hasn't been set up yet.

## Solution

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to the **SQL Editor** tab
3. Copy the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/20250802172431_accounting_pro_complete_schema.sql`
4. Paste it into the SQL Editor
5. Click **Run** to execute the migration
6. Refresh your application

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI
1. Install Supabase CLI if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   npm install -g supabase
   ```

2. Initialize Supabase in your project:
   ```bash
   supabase init
   ```

3. Link to your project:
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   ```

4. Push the migrations:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

### Option 3: Manual Setup
If the above options don't work, you can manually create the tables:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Run each CREATE TABLE statement from the migration file one by one
3. Make sure to run them in order (types first, then tables, then policies)

## Verification
After running the migration, you should see these tables in your Supabase dashboard:
- user_profiles
- accounts
- clients
- transactions
- reports
- tax_filings
- bank_accounts
- bank_transactions
- documents
- activity_logs

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" errors
- Make sure you're using the correct Supabase project
- Check that your VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY are correct

### "Project paused" errors
- Free tier Supabase projects pause after 1 week of inactivity
- Go to your Supabase dashboard and click "Resume" to reactivate

### Connection timeout
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Supabase service status at status.supabase.com

## Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file contains:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```
